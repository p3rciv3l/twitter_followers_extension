# twitter_followers_extension
X (fka Twitter) Analytics does not show follower count over time, but instead shows followers gained and lost on a day-to-day basis. This makes is difficult to quickly assess growth, so I built this extension to make it easy to visualize this. This project uses the Lllama 90B Vision model and Fireworks to serve the model.
